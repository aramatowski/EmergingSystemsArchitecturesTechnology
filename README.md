# EmergingSystemsArchitecturesTechnology

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I have submitted the edited code and reflection for the final project of this course. The edited code was created to be a prototype for a smart thermostat hardware. It was designed to detect and read the room temperature and frequent intervals, and allow the user to adjust the temperature setting. The reflection describes how peripherals, the cloud, and flash and RAM were utilized in the project.

## What did you do particularly well?
I kept my edited code organized and easy to read. I utilized comments and spacing within my code to achieve this.

## Where could you improve?
I need more practice working with computer hardware and embedded devices. I could improve with more successful code with more practice. 

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding Code Composer Studio and many resources from Texas Instruments website to my support network.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
In this project, I had a lot of errors that I had to work through. This has expanded my ability to work through errors and more quickly resolve them.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I utilized comments and spacing in my code to make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
